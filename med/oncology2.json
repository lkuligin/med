Temperature is 36.8 \u00b0C (98.2 F), blood pressure is 140/84 mm Hg, pulse is 92/min, and respirations are 20/min. Oxygen saturation is 96% on room air. On physical examination, the patient is somnolent but rouses to voice. Pupils are equal and briskly reactive. There is no facial droop, but a small laceration on the lateral border of the tongue is present. MRI imaging demonstrates a large infltrative tumor involving the corpus callosum and right middle frontal gyrus, and does not enhance with contrast. The patient undergoes frontoparietal craniotomy.
